\title{Plot tree (Merging Path Plot)}
\usage{
plotTree(factorMerger, stat = "model", simplify = TRUE,
  showDiagnostics = TRUE, alpha = 0.05)
}
\arguments{
\item{factorMerger}{Object of a class \code{factorMerger}.}

\item{stat}{Summary statistic to be displayed on the OX axis. It can be either
\code{"model"} (loglikelihood), the default, or \code{"pval"} (pvalue).}

\item{simplify}{If \code{TRUE}, tree leaves are plotted uniformly. Otherwise, each node
position (on the OY axis) is connected with a group statistic for observations represented
by the node. By default \code{simplify = TRUE} is used.}

\item{showDiagnostics}{If \code{TRUE}:
\itemize{
\item if \code{stat = "model"}, vertical line is drawn for a model with lowest GIC,
\item if \code{stat = "pval"}, vertical line is drawn for significance level \code{alpha}.
}}

\item{alpha}{significance level used when \code{showDiagnostics = TRUE} and \code{stat = "pval"}.}
}
\description{
Visualizes merging history of a \code{factorMerger}.
}
\details{
When \code{stat = "model"} each interval in the OX axis corresponds to the quantile 0.95
of chi-square distribution with one degree of freedom.
